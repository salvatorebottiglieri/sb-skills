  Process a batch of work items: implement each via a TDD subagent, review
  via a reviewer subagent, fix until clean, align docs, then create a PR.

  Use when the user says "implement these issues", "process this queue",
  "agentic loop", or passes a list of items to implement. User-invoked only.

# Implementation Loop

A disciplined agentic loop for implementing work items one at a time:
**implement → review → fix → align docs → PR**. Every change goes through a
subagent; the main agent never edits code during the loop.

## 0. Setup

- Read the items from wherever the user's issue tracker lives (the user
  tells you where — GitHub Issues, GitLab, Linear, a local file, etc.).
- Identify the spec source per item (the item body IS the spec).
- Check for dependencies between items — order them so no item depends on
  unmerged work. Resolve dependencies sequentially; run independent items in
  parallel with `worktree: true`.

## 1. Implement — delegate to a subagent

Spawn a `worker` subagent with `context: "fresh"` (`async: true`) with:

- The full item body (title + description) as the task.
- `Use /tdd (test-driven development).` at the top of the task.
- The relevant file paths and code context the subagent needs (current
  function signatures, API, existing test patterns).
- A clear list of files the subagent **may** modify vs **must not** touch.
- The acceptance criteria from the item.

Do not implement yourself. Do not edit files. The subagent is the sole writer.

**Always pass `context: "fresh"`** so the worker starts with a clean context
window and receives only the information you explicitly include in the task
string. Inheriting the parent session's context (the default for `fork` agents)
causes the worker to see unrelated messages, files, and decisions that can
drift its output — or worse, skip making edits because it hallucinates the
changes are already applied.

## 2. Review — delegate to a reviewer

When the implement subagent completes, spawn two `reviewer` subagents with
`context: "fresh"` in sequence (or parallel if the tool allows):

- **Standards review**: full diff against HEAD + code smell baseline (Fowler,
  Refactoring ch.3). Report per-file findings.
- **Spec review**: compare the diff against the item body verbatim — both
  the description and the acceptance criteria checklist. For each acceptance
  criterion (the `- [ ]` list), report whether it is correctly implemented
  (pass), incorrectly implemented (fail), or not implemented (missing).
  A criterion counts as "correctly implemented" only if the code demonstrably
  satisfies it — not if a test for it exists but the logic is wrong. Reference
  specific lines or test assertions for each claim. Also report any gaps,
  scope creep, or wrong implementations against the item description.
Both reviewers are read-only. They do not edit code.

**Always pass `context: "fresh"`** so each reviewer sees only the diff and
the review criteria you provide, not the entire chat history. A reviewer that
inherits the parent session may confuse its mandate with the implementer's or
the loop manager's.

## 3. Fix — delegate, never fix directly

If either review finds actionable issues:

1. **Spawn a fresh `worker` subagent** with `context: "fresh"` (`async: true`)
   to fix them. Pass the review findings **verbatim** as task context.
2. In the task, tell the subagent *which files* to change and *what
   specifically* to fix (quote the findings). Include the current diff for
   context.
3. **Be explicit in the fix task**: tell the subagent to edit files and run
   tests. A fix subagent that inherits context may plan without acting —
   `context: "fresh"` prevents this by forcing you to put every instruction
   in the task string.
4. When the fix subagent completes, go back to **step 2** (re-review).
4. Exit the loop only when both reviews return **zero actionable findings**.

**Hard rule**: the main agent never edits code during the fix loop. Not
  formatting, not comments, not one-line renames. Every change goes through a
  subagent. The only exception: findings classified as purely mechanical
  (whitespace, typos, comments). Behavioural, structural, or logic changes
  always delegate.

## 4. Align docs

When all items pass review and before creating the PR, check whether the
code changes need documentation updates:

1. **Identify affected docs**: grep the diff for changes that touch public
   APIs, CLI flags, config formats, environment variables, data schemas,
   architecture decisions (ADRs), or anything documented externally.
2. **Check project conventions**: look for `CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`,
   `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/adr/`, or any `*_docs/` directory that maps
   to the changed code.
3. **Delegate doc updates**: if the diff changes something documented, spawn
   a `worker` subagent with `context: "fresh"` to:
   - Read the relevant docs and the code diff.
   - Update docs to match the new behaviour.
   - Skip docs that are still accurate — no speculative rewrites.
4. **No news is good news**: if nothing documented changed, skip this phase
   entirely. The PR step proceeds directly.

## 5. PR

When all items pass review and docs are aligned:

1. `git checkout -b <branch-name>` (descriptive, e.g. `feat-<issue-number>`)
2. `git add` the changed files (only what belongs to the task)
3. `git commit -m "..."` with a conventional commit message referencing the items
4. `git push origin <branch-name>`
5. Create a PR using the project's standard tooling (ask the user how).
6. Close/resolve each completed item in the issue tracker.

## Dependency resolution

- **Sequential**: if item B depends on item A's code, implement A → review A
  → fix A → align docs A → merge A (or at least commit A on a shared base)
  → then implement B. No worktree needed for sequential.
- **Parallel**: if items are independent, run each through the full
  implement/review/fix/align-docs loop in its own git worktree (`worktree: true`
  on the subagent call). Merge them in dependency order.

## Completion criterion per item

The loop is done with an item when:
- All acceptance criteria from the item description are met
- All tests pass (existing + new)
- A reviewer (Standards + Spec) reports zero actionable findings
- Docs are aligned with the change (or confirmed unnecessary)
- The item is referenced in a PR or commit
